# portfolio
**This is my portfolio project**
My portfolio primarily focuses on reflecting my UX/UI skills, services. I also demonstrate my web developemnt knowledge (as I coded this web application). 
I had so much fun when completing this work because I had a chance to improve and master knowledge I already gained and I also took the opportunity to implement new practices. For example, recently I learned about Bootstrap that is why I decided to incorporate it into my project. 
For my portfolio I also used flexbox and grid system. I made my website accessible for various size screen devices by adding media queries to make it responsive.
